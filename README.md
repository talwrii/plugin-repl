# Plugin REPL - In Editor JavaScript Scripting for Automation
**readwithai** - [ùïè](https://x.com/readwithai) k[ü¶ã](https://bsky.app/profile/readwithai.bsky.social) - [blog](https://readwithai.substack.com/) - [machine-aided reading](https://www.reddit.com/r/machineAidedReading/)

Rapidly automate tasks from within notes. Rapidly test and iterate on code for plugins without needing to reload.

Plugin REPL adds an Emacs-like read evaluate print loop (REPL) to Obsidian.
This lets you execute JavaScript directly in a document with a single key-press and see the result.
It lets you interact with Obsidian's plugin API to make Obsidian do things (move the cursor, insert text, open files, etc). Once you have working code you define new commands directly in JavaScript.

Plugin REPL can be useful when developing plugins or for "light-weight" scripting without having to develop a full plugin.

A range of convenience functions, partly inspired by emacs, is provided to speed up development of straight-forward features.

*I am in no way affiliated with Obsidian. This is a third-party plugin.*

# Installation
Plugin REPL is available from within Obsidian as a [community plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=plugin-repl).

Alternatively, you can manually install Plugin REPL:

In your vault, there should be a `.obsidian/plugins` directory. You can clone this repo into that
directory and then run the following to build the plugin:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

You should then be able to enable the plugin in the "Community Plugins" section of Obsidian's settings.

## Using
For basic usage, write a JavaScript expression on a line, then run the command "Execute the current line or selection" in the Command Palette. You can also select a region and run this command.
I would advise making `CTRL-J` run this command with a hotkey.

Some other commands are provided. You can find them in the Command Palette by typing "Plugin REPL". These let you to execute a region of JavaScript without inserting the result, or read JavaScript to run from a popup window.

To define a *command* (run via the [Command Palette]( https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Command+palette) or a hotkey) use the [newCommand](#commands) function.

The code you write can make use of the [convenience functions and variables](#convenience). This may well provide all the functionality you need for basic scripts, but Plugin REPL also gives you access to much of [Obsidian's plugin API](https://docs.obsidian.md/Plugins/Getting+started/Build+a+plugin)
through the `app`, `editor` and `repl` (plugin) objects.

The `dir` and `fuzzyDir` methods can help explore these objects allong with the [API documentation](https://docs.obsidian.md/Plugins/Getting+started/Build+a+plugin).

If you want functionality, such as defined commands, to [rerun each time Obsidian loads](#startup) you can put this functionality in a `repl.md` file in your vault.

IMPORTANT LIMITATION. Functions that you define are not shared between different invocations of plugin repl. To share them, you must instead define them as variables like so: `var f = function f() {`

## Documentation
This page provides an overview of functionality. You might like to look at the [Obsidian and Plugin Repl Cookbook](https://readwithai.substack.com/p/obsidian-plugin-repl-cookbook), which provides various practical examples of how Plugin REPL can be used.

* `replRequire(s: string)` - Import the node module installed using [Plugin Repl Imports](
https://github.com/talwrii/plugin-repl-imports)


### API access
* `repl` is the Obsidian plugin object for Plugin REPL. You can use this to define commands and register extensions.
* `editor` is the Editor object. You can use this to edit to the current note
* `app` is the global application object.

## Defining commands
<a name="commands"></a>
The function `newCommand` will create a new command which calls a function. Once you have defined a command, you can
define a hotkey to run this command and so call this function.

```javascript
newCommand(function new_command_name() {
...
})
```

creates a command with the name "new command name" (and the id `new_command_name`).

You can use all Plugin REPL's extra functions and variables (`app`, `editor` etc) within this function.

If you want to test this funtion by hand, you can do the following:

```javascript
var f = newCommand(function new_command_name() {
...
})
```

You can then call `f()` by executing code to test it.

## Running code at startup
<a name="startup"> </a>
If you want code to run at startup, such as for [defining commands](#commands), then you can place this code in a special file called `repl.md`. If this file exists, it is read when Obsidian starts (or is reloaded) and the code in it is executed.

## Asynchronous code
For convenience, if you call an asynchronous function, Plugin REPL will store the result in the variable `_`.  If there was an error, the error is stored in `_error`.

## Images and Graphs
In order to output images and graphs, you can use code-blocks. These give you access to an `el` HTML object you can use to store arbitrary HTML. Note that all JavaScript executes in a single global scope by design.

````
```plugin-repl
el.appendText("hello")
```
````
## Dataview support
The [dataview plugin](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) provides
functionality to query your obsidian vault. For example, it can return pages or bullet points that match a particular query.

If you have installed the dataview plugin, Plugin REPL gives you access to a dataview object `dv` which can be used to query all notes.


The following code returns the first list of the page called `templates/daily.md`.

```javascript
dv = getDv()
dv.pages().filter((x) => x.file.path == "templates/daily.md")[0].file.lists[0]
```

## Templater support
The [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) library provides functionality to insert templates with some parts of the template derived from JavaScript code. If you have installed Templater, you can use
the async `templater_expand` function to expand template strings.

This creates a command that inserts a files tags using a template:
```
newCommand(async function templater_example() {
    insert(await templater_expand("The files tags: <% tp.file.tags %>"))
})
```

If you want to expand a template for a file, you can use `readFile`:
```
newCommand(async function templater_from_file() {
    insert(await templater_expand(await readFile("myTemplate")))
})
```

## Importing modules
Modules in Obsidian work in an interesting way that makes installing from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) a little tricky. There is a [technical explanation here](https://github.com/talwrii/plugin-repl-imports#technical).

Plugin REPL has a system to let you import npm modules provided by [this repository](https://github.com/talwrii/plugin-repl-imports). To use it, you have to checkout a repository into your vault, update a text file, run a make command and then you can use the `replRequire` function within Obsidian

## Some questions and answers about Plugin REPL
[Questions and answers](questions.md)

## Alternatives and prior work
* You can [use plugins](https://docs.obsidian.md/Plugins/Getting+started/Build+a+plugin) to do the same things that you can do with Plugin REPL but this tends to mean more code.
* [js-engine](https://github.com/mProjectsCode/obsidian-js-engine-plugin) lets you evaulate JavaScript code in code blocks. [Execute code](https://github.com/twibiral/obsidian-execute-code) gives you code blocks in multiple programming languages. Neither give you access to Obsidian API objects to let you do scripting.

* [dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) similarly lets you execute JavaScript in code blocks.  It gives you access to the `app` object.
* [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) defines a template language with JavaScript code blocks. It's API gives you access to the `app` object and people have used "Templates" that when run script Obsidian.
* [Obsidian runjs](https://github.com/eoureo/obsidian-runjs) is quite similar in that it allows you to run code from within Obsidian. There is a special syntax for blocks that then show up in a side bar. Plugin REPL is easier to use in my opinion since you can just run code and use the command interface.

Many plugins can create commands at run time from within Obsidian - but they tend to be for more specific uses. I was influenced by [obsidian-open-settings](https://github.com/Mara-Li/obsidian-open-settings) for this, as well as for the `openSettings` command.

Both [dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) and [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) implement provide APIs that wrap and simplify aspects of the Obsidian API, [Templater's](https://silentvoid13.github.io/Templater/internal-functions/internal-modules/app-module.html) is rather more complete

# Attribution
This plugin was based on the [Obsidian sample plugin](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin) from Obsidian.

It uses the [shell-quote](https://github.com/ljharb/shell-quote) library by ljharb and the source code for this is compiled into distribited `main.js`. This is under an MIT license.

At runtime, it binds against [dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) by blacksmith,  should you use dataview functionality. This is under an MIT license.

This plugin is highly influenced by [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) (as are most text editors and a lot of software).

This code exposes and wraps the [Obsidian plugin API](https://docs.obsidian.md/Plugins/Getting+started/Build+a+plugin) - as all plugins do - but Plugin REPL does this in a rather more direct / turing-complete way.
